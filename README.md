# read.dmdx
This is an R package for reading [DXDM] (http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kforster/dmdx/dmdx.htm) item files (in RTF format; can be in plain text format too) as well as parsing .azk files generated by [DMDX] (http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kforster/dmdx/dmdx.htm).

This parckage is at a very early stage of development, so **please use at your own risk!**. I have not had a chance to play with many test cases, as I only had access to a few priming scripts. All contributions, suggestions, bug reports, and test case submissions are welcome.

## Installation
To install the package from GitHub, first install devtools and its dependencies. Then run 
```
devtools::install_github("matsukik/read.dmdx")
```

## Examples

To import a 'azk' data file:
```
library(read.dmdx)
dat <- read.azk('LexicalDesicion_List1.azk')
dim(dat)
head(dat)
```

To import a 'rtf' item file:
```
items <- read.dmdx('LexicalDesision_List1.rtf')
head(items$itemdat)
```
